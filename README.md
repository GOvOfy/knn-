using  airbnb data  to predict price through KNN
after add feature number of reviews, I found that the mse between predicted_price and price became higher than the data before add this feature.
when I compare with the price, I found that, when there is less number of reviews, it usually matches the real price. when the number of reviews goes higher. The price usually higher than the real price. I think it can reflect the people's opinion when they do reviews. 
future goal: how to judge people's opinion through text.
